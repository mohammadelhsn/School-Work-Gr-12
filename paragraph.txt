THIS SENTENCE HAS FIVE WORDS. HERE ARE FIVE MORE WORDS. FIVE-WORD SENTENCES ARE FINE. BUT SEVERAL TOGETHER BECOME MONOTONOUS. LISTEN TO WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE WRITING IS GETTING BORING. THE SOUND OF IT DRONES. IT'S LIKE A STUCK RECORD. THE EAR DEMANDS SOME VARIETY. NOW LISTEN. I VARY THE SENTENCE LENGTH, AND I CREATE MUSIC. MUSIC. THE WRITING SINGS. IT HAS A PLEASANT RHYTHM, A LILT, A HARMONY. I USE SHORT SENTENCES. AND I USE SENTENCES OF MEDIUM LENGTH. AND SOMETIMES, WHEN I AM CERTAIN THE READER IS RESTED, I WILL ENGAGE HIM WITH A SENTENCE OF CONSIDERABLE LENGTH, A SENTENCE THAT BURNS WITH ENERGY AND BUILDS WITH ALL THE IMPETUS OF A CRESCENDO, THE ROLL OF THE DRUMS, THE CRASH OF THE CYMBALS, SOUNDS THAT SAY LISTEN TO THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT.
